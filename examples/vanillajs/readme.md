# Vanilla ES6 (ES2015) â€¢ [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com)

This is a rewrite of the incoming ES2015 app for TodoMVC that works out of the box in Chrome 49+ without the need for a transpiler. 

Full ES2015 support in a browser would allow Luke Edwards [original](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/pull/1515) ES2015 app to run without any modifications needed.
